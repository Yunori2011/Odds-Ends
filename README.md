# Odds-Ends

Just a little minecraft mod to add something I've been adding through minetweaker for a long time that I want as a compact mod.

Thanks to Pahimar for his excellent tutorial and his code that he has so generiously given the community to use. I wouldn't be anywhere without these.

My understanding of Java itself is limited, and I'm not entirely certain on the backend on many of the methods I used. If how I describe them in my comments is simply false, you'll have to forgive my ignorance.
